## Features
- **Mobile application:** Citizens can easily and quickly inform competent authorities when they face problems on the cycling network. A photo and a short description quickly communicate the information and ensure an effective resolution of the problem.

- **Dashbord:** For cities and municipalities, our dashboard allows them to see in real time the problems on their network. The map view provides an overview and the list view informs the administrator of the details of each problem. The filters make it easy to find the different types and states of problems.
