# Cartovelo Frontend

This folder contains the code of Cartovelo's admin UI. It is based on [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), a starter project for Angular-based apps.

## How to use

### 1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/QuriousDev/Cartovelo.git
cd Cartovelo/Frontend
```

If you just want to start a new project without the Cartovelo commit history, then you can do:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/QuriousDev/Cartovelo.git <your-project-name>
```

The depth=1 tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### 2. Install the dependencies using NPM

```
npm install
```

### 3. Start the webapp

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `localhost:8000`.
